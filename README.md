The code for my project is a password generator as well as password checker.

Firstly, there is the menu you are greated with. allowing you to choose between 1 and 2 which are a password generator and a password strength checker!

The generator asks how many characters you would like in your password, and will add randomly generated charcters up to your selected amount of characters up to your given number. Then you are given a choice to restart or going back to the original menu.

The password checeker will take your input and go through a checklist to determine if the given password would be considered strong by most accounts by going by having both capital and lowercase letters, special symbols, numbers and even the length of the password. Allowing you to alter your password to make a stronger password.
